You will need to set all of the files within the JavaScriptTests\ and JavaScriptTests\Scripts folders to "Copy if newer" so they get copied to the output directory and can be found by the test runner.

Other than that you are up and running now.

Edit JavaScriptTests\test.html and JavaScriptTests\tests.js to create tests. Add as many .html files as you like to the JavaScriptTests folder to add new tests. If you want to edit the NUnit integration you can edit the files in JavaScriptTests\NQUnit.
